Problem 06_01_Numeral_System
Write a program that reads the digits of a base-10 numeral system – exactly 10 unique non-space characters on a single line, 
representing the symbols used for the digits 0-9 (inclusively) – then reads two numbers represented in that numeral system, 
then prints their sum in that numeral system

Examples
Input1	
abcdefghij
cba
ja	
Output:	daa

Explanation: 
a=0, b=1, …, j=9
cba = 210
ja = 90
90 + 210 = 300 = daa

Input2
0123456789
42
512	
Output: 554	
Numeral system matches normal base-10 (0=0, 1=1, …, 9=9)
